                <h1>What Is Bike Insurance?</h1>
                <p>Bike insurance, or two-wheeler insurance, takes care of riders with regard to the staggering cost of attending to the injuries they sustain while colliding with other vehicles, objects, and even pedestrians. Because of this insurance, which serves as a contract between the insurers and the owners, the owners are sheltered from unanticipated financial burdens that may arise due to theft, fire, natural disasters, and even third-party claims. In a developing city like Lucknow which is booming and has rising traffic as well as road perils, having appropriate bike insurance coverage is a necessity. Moreover, third-party bike insurance is a requirement as per the Motor Vehicle Act of 1988. This law provides the owner with legal and financial cover. Along with this, bike owners in Lucknow face penalties, making it compulsory for new riders to buy 5 years of insurance to circumvent a ₹2,000 challan and enjoy stress-free riding.</p>

                <h1>Types Of Two-Wheeler<br>Insurance Policies In India</h1>
                <p class="intro-paragraph">In general, Indian insurance firms offer three different kinds of bike insurance plans. You can get comprehensive bike insurance, own-damage bike insurance, and third-party bike insurance policies based on your needs and budget.</p>
                
                <ul class="policy-list">
                    <li>
                        <h2>Insurance for Third-Party Bikes</h2>
                        <p>The liability damage from third-party bicycle insurance declines any legal obligations that may arise from harming other people or their property in an auto accident for the insured. The Indian Motor Vehicles Act of 1988 requires all two-wheeler owners to have current third-party insurance for their vehicles before they can drive them on public roads.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Bike Insurance for Personal Damage</h2>
                        <p>Another name for own-damage (OD) bike insurance is standalone OD coverage. It offers monetary compensation for harm to the insured bike from fire, theft, and other mishaps. Having this policy in addition to required third-party insurance is advised for comprehensive protection.</p>

      <h2>Straight From The Experts</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the country’s diverse geographic and economic circumstances, two-wheelers have traditionally played a significant role in India’s transportation system. Driving that superbike can be a source of alternative money for some, but it can also be a goal and a passion for others. The requirement for financial security against theft or other unanticipated harm brought on by accidents or natural disasters like floods or fires, however, is something that all segments share.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to preventing third-party liabilities and heavy fines for driving without a legal insurance policy, the “Two-Wheeler Insurance Policy” comes to the rescue.

                <h3>Financial Protection</h3>
                <p>Providing financial protection against the policyholder's premium is the main goal of any insurance policy. Here, it offers defence against expensive repairs or replacement of the damaged bike in the event of a theft, accident, natural disaster, or other covered risk.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Covers Third-Party Liabilities</h3>
                <p>The coverage covers the monetary and legal repercussions if the insured bike injures or damages a third party, person, or piece of damage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Peace Of Mind</h3>

        <h1>Add-Ons For Bike Insurance</h1>

        <ul class="addons-list">
            <li>
                <h3>Personal Accident Cover</h3>
                <p>The owner of the covered two-wheeler can opt for mandatory Personal Accident (PA) coverage as an add-on to their bike insurance. The highest coverage provided is ₹15 lakh, according to the IRDAI. In the event of an unexpected death in a traffic accident, it provides the policyholder's nominee with full reimbursement. Additionally, it provides benefits if the policyholder is hurt or rendered permanently disabled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Zero Depreciation Cover</h3>
                <p>Your bike's depreciation value is subtracted before the insurer pays the claim amount. Bicycle insurance with zero depreciation coverage removes all deductions for depreciation at the time of claim payment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>NCB Protection Cover</h3>
                <p>You can receive a discount when renewing your comprehensive or own-damage premium for each year that you have no claims. In bike insurance, this is referred to as the No Claim Bonus (NCB). The range of this NCB is 10% to 50%. With the help of NCB protection cover in bike insurance, you can retain the NCB and earn a discount on renewals, even if they raise any claim during their policy tenure.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>24/7 Roadside Assistance (RSA) Cover</h3>
                <p>When you purchase roadside assistance add-on coverage, your insurer will provide you with round-the-clock assistance for your bike or electronic bike in the event of an emergency (within the radius stated in your policy documentation). In the event of a breakdown, emergency fuel assistance, flat tyre assistance, lost key assistance, minor repairs, etc., you are covered by the roadside assistance portion of bike insurance. Additionally, the NCB discount does not change because any services rendered under this coverage are not considered claims.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Coverage of Return to Invoice (RTI)</h3>
                <p>Your insurance provider will pay you the "Insured Declared Value (IDV)" if the insured bike is stolen or completely lost. Nonetheless, if your bike insurance policy includes Return to Invoice coverage, it will fill the discrepancy between the IDV and the invoice/on-road price of your car, including taxes and registration, enabling you to get the purchase price as the claim sum.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Engine Protection Cover</h3>
                <p>This is an essential cover if you reside in an area that experiences flooding or waterlogging on a regular basis. If the covered two-wheeler engine is partially or completely damaged due to lubricant oil leaks, water intrusion, hydrostatic lock damage, etc., bicycle engine protection insurance reimburses the insured party. The engine protection cover also protects the insured bike's engine parts, including crankshafts, connecting rods, cylinders, and pistons, from harm.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Coverage of Consumables</h3>
                <p>The crucial components that the bike needs to function properly are referred to as consumables. Common consumables needed to operate the bike include coolant, chain lubricants, braking fluids, engine oil, nuts, and bolts. The insurer reimburses the cost of consumables up to a certain maximum with the aid of bike consumables coverage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Coverage for Passengers and Pillion Riders</h3>
                <p>In bike insurance, a passenger cover, often called a pillion rider policy, provides extra financial protection to the rider or co-passenger in the event of a collision. The pillion rider is covered by the add-on if they suffer physical harm or pass away as a result of an accident or other insured hazard specified in the policy documentation.</p>
            </li>

<!-- Bike Insurance Premium Online? -->



 <div class="calculator-container">
        <h1>How To Calculate Bike Insurance Premium Online?</h1>
        
        <p>The PolicyGhar bike insurance premium calculator can be used to determine your projected bike insurance premium by following these steps:</p>

        <ul class="steps-list">
            <li>
                <h3>Step 1: Enter the information about your bike:</h3>
                <p>The liability damage from third-party bicycle insurance declines any legal obligations that may arise from harming other people or their property in an auto accident for the insured. The Indian Motor Vehicles Act of 1988 requires all two-wheeler owners to have current third-party insurance for their vehicles before they can drive them on public roads.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 2: Submit Your Registration and Claim Information</h3>
                <p>Indicate if you have filed any claims during the preceding policy period, and choose your city or RTO of registration.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 3: Submit Your Registration and Claim Information</h3>
                <p>Your chosen bike model's estimated premium will be displayed immediately by the calculator. You can also choose from a variety of two-wheeler insurance policies offered by different providers. After comparing options according to coverage and premium, pick the one that best suits your requirements.</p>

<!-- factors-container -->

     <div class="factors-container">
        <h1>Factors Influencing The Cost Of Bike Insurance</h1>

        <ul class="factors-list">
            <li>
                <h3>Make, Model, and Variant of the Bike</h3>
                <p>High-end or powerful bikes (sports bikes, luxury bikes, etc.) typically have higher premiums because they are more likely to be stolen and their spare parts are more costly, which raises the cost of repairs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Age of the Bike</h3>
                <p>As the bike ages, depreciation causes its worth, or IDV (current market value), to decline. Usually, it reduces the premium.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Location of Registration</h3>
                <p>Two-wheelers registered in urban areas or areas with a high accident rate are subject to additional registration fees. This is due to the increased risk of traffic jams, accidents, and theft, which is a common problem.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Type of Coverage Chosen</h3>
                <p>Keep in mind that because of its restricted coverage, a third-party bike insurance policy is the most economical. Comprehensive bike insurance plans, on the other hand, provide more protection and the ability to tack on extras, but the cost is greater.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Add-ons and Customisations</h3>
                <p>You can select add-ons like engine protection cover, pillion rider cover, or zero-dep cover to increase coverage. Your premium will go up over the standard policy as a result.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

<div class="save-premium-container">
        <h1>How To Save On Bike Insurance Premium?</h1>
        <p>There are several ways to lower the cost of your two-wheeler insurance without compromising the policy's coverage. Here are some crucial pointers to reduce the cost of bike premiums:</p>

        <ul class="tips-list">
            <li>
                <h3>Claim your NCB</h3>
                <p>For each year without a claim, you will receive a No Claim Bonus. With your NCB, you can receive premium savings without lowering the extent of your coverage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Recognise the Age of Your Vehicle</h3>
                <p>Older motorcycles typically have lower premiums because their Insured Declared Value (IDV) is lower.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Install safety equipment</h3>
                <p>The majority of insurance companies will consider the safety features you install, like an anti-theft alarm, and reduce your premium.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Select Your Bike's CC Wisely</h3>
                <p>Selecting the engine cubic capacity (CC) of your car is crucial since a greater CC results in a higher premium. As a result, you must carefully select the engine CC.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Choose a Higher Voluntary Deductible</h3>
                <p>As you pay a specific amount out of pocket, deductibles reduce the insurer's obligation to pay the claim amount. Consequently, you will receive reduced premium rates if you choose a high voluntary deductible.</p>
            </li>

        <h1>How To Claim Two-Wheeler Insurance Online?</h1>
        
        <p>You have the option to file a bike insurance claim against your two-wheeler in the event of an accident, theft, or significant damage. In contrast to OD and comprehensive bike insurance, which also cover damage to your vehicle, a third-party bike insurance policy will only pay claims for damage to third parties.</p>
        
        <p>You can submit cashless or reimbursement claims for your bike insurance at PolicyGhar.com.</p>
        
        <div class="claim-section">
            <h2>The Process of Cashless Claim Settlement</h2>
            <p>If you want to file a cashless claim, the network garage where the repairs are made will receive the claim money directly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="claim-section">
            <h2>Settlement Procedure for Reimbursement Claims</h2>

        <ul class="claim-steps-list">
            <li>If your bike is stolen, file an official report at the local police station.</li>
            <li>Inform your insurer about the occurrence.</li>
            <li>Your bike's damage will be evaluated by a surveyor.</li>
            <li>Send in the claim form together with the necessary paperwork for your bike insurance claim.</li>
            <li>The repair request will be approved by the insurance.</li>
            <li>For repairs, take your bike to a network garage.</li>
            <li>The insurer will either reimburse the repair cost or pay the garage directly for the repairs. Only the non-covered or deductible costs will be your responsibility.</li>

     <div class="terms-container">
        <h1>Common Bike Insurance Terms</h1>

        <ul class="terms-list">
            <li>
                <h3>Third-Party Liability Insurance</h3>
                <p>One kind of liability insurance that covers other people's losses and injuries in the case of an accident involving a covered bike is third-party bike insurance. The Indian Motor Vehicle Act mandates that all two-wheeler owners follow this rule.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Personal Injury Protection</h3>
                <p>A coverage known as "own-damage bike insurance," or "OD cover," guards against theft, fire, accidents, natural disasters, and malevolent conduct. Usually obtained in conjunction with third-party bike insurance coverage, it is an optional policy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The cost of bike insurance</h3>
                <p>A bike insurance premium is the entire amount of money paid to maintain your coverage, and it depends on a number of parameters, including as the policy type, the age of the bike, the city in which it is registered, the make, model, and variant, among others.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Deductible</h3>
                <p>Your bike insurance deductible is the sum you agree to pay toward the resolution of an unintended claim.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>NCB, or No Claim Bonus</h3>
                <p>No claim bonus, or NCB, is a benefit for not submitting claims during the policy period that lowers your personal damage premium at renewal for bike insurance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Insured Declared Value (IDV)</h3>
                <p>When it comes to bike insurance, the insured declared value, or IDV, is the maximum amount that the insurance provider will guarantee in the case of complete loss or theft. Depreciation and the bike's listed price are both taken into account when calculating this total.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Endorsement of Policies</h3>
                <p>Endorsement is the process of adding or modifying terms and conditions to your bike insurance policy. With your insurer, you may easily submit a request for an endorsement of your bike insurance policy and make the necessary modifications.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Inclusions and Exclusions of the Policy</h3>
                <p>The inclusions and exclusions of a bike insurance policy are the risks and situations that are covered by the insurance provider and those that are not covered in return for a premium.
You must carefully study them before buying the coverage in order to prevent surprises during the claim settlement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Add-on Covers</h3>
                <p>Additional coverages for riders that provide additional protection against certain risks not covered by the main policy are known as bike insurance add-ons. Bike insurance packages often contain coverage for engine protection, zero depreciation, personal accident (PA), and other add-ons.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cashless Claim</h3>
                <p>The policyholder can have their damaged two-wheeler fixed at an authorised network garage without having to pay anything up front, thanks to cashless claims in bike insurance. The insurance company pays the cost directly in this case.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Claim Reimbursement</h3>
                <p>The policyholder has the option of selecting which garage to hire to fix their damaged two-wheeler when submitting a claim for bike insurance reimbursement. In this instance, the insurance company reimburses the policyholder later into their bank account.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Renewal of Bike Insurance</h3>
                <p>Bike insurance renewal is the process of keeping your policy in effect after its expiration date. It is necessary to guarantee continuous coverage and avoid lapses.</p>
            </li>
